I am  a <a href="https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/zhou-pan-7776">tenure-track  Assistant Professor</a> at the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University (SMU).  

Prior to this position, I held roles as a Senior Research Scientist at Sea AI Lab and as a Research Scientist at Salesforce. I completed my Ph.D. degree at the National University of Singapore (NUS), fortunately advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/">Prof. Jiashi Feng</a> and <a href="https://yanshuicheng.info/"> Prof. Shuicheng Yan</a>. Before studying in NUS, I graduated from Peking University (PKU) where I had the honor to work with <a href="https://zhouchenlin.github.io/"> Prof. Zhouchen Lin</a> 	and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeCCx-kAAAAJ&hl=en"> Prof. Chao Zhang</a>.  I also collaborated closely with    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xtyuan1980/"> Prof. Xiaotong Yuan</a>. 	I also spent several wonderful months at Georgia Tech in 2018  and Princeton University in 2019  as a visiting student.

  <a name="interests"></a> <strong>Research Interests</strong>
</h6>
My  target is to build <strong>“efficient and effective artificial intelligent systems”</strong> so that machines can cognize, understand and interact with the environment. Currently, I mainly focus on three research topics across machine learning, computer vision and optimization.  See more details <a href="https://panzhous.github.io/research/">here</a>.
<div class="highlight"> 
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Learning framework</strong>: how to learn knowledge from (unlabeled) data effectively and efficiently? E.g. self-supervised  (multi-modal) learning and generative models like diffusion models for image/3D/video.</li>
      <li><strong>Network architecture design</strong>: how to design more advanced neural network architectures?</li>
      <li><strong>Parameter optimizer</strong>: how to design training algorithms like Adam to efficiently train AI models? </li>
  </ul>
